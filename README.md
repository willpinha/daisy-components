</div>

## 🌸 About

I used DaisyUI in some projects and the amount of functionality it offers without any JavaScript code is incredible, not to mention the different themes
and colors available

I didn't find more complex usage examples for DaisyUI anywhere, so I decided to create this repository. I hope it inspires you in your projects!

## 🌸 Features

- Mobile-first UI components
- Supports all 32 DaisyUI themes
- Free and open source, forever

## 🌸 Installing

You don't need to install anything! Just copy and paste any component into your project

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All components are made with DaisyUI and TailwindCSS, so make sure you have these dependencies in your 
> project. We also use [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) for the icons, but you can replace it 
> with any other icon library
